# Hi there, I'm Rushikesh Jadhav! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in software development and open-source contributions. Here's a little bit about me:

Hello, I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student who loves building useful and creative tech projects. I enjoy working with full-stack development, machine learning, and cloud tools to turn ideas into real solutions. I believe in the mindset "Never back down💪🏻", which helps me stay motivated in both my work and life.
Outside of coding, I also love running 🏃🏻 — whether it's marathons, ultra-marathons, or just challenging myself to go further. These experiences have taught me the value of patience, hard work, and never giving up.
I'm always excited to meet new people, learn new things, and work on interesting projects. Feel free to connect — I'd love to share ideas and build something great together! 🌟
